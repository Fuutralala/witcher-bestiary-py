    "Saying a botchling's ugly is like saying shit's not particularly tasty:
    can't say it's a lie, but it doesn't exactly convey the whole truth, either.
    - Lambert, witcher of the Wolf School

    Botchling is a small creature, resembling a highly deformed fetus,
    created from the improper burial of unwanted,
    stillborn infants that preys on pregnant women. While hiding beneath beds,
    botchlings sap the expectant mother of strength and once she is completely
    defenseless it will latch on and directly feed off blood,
    killing both her and the unborn child.

    As botchlings are born from improper burial rites and were unwanted,
    one can transform them into a lubberkin by performing the elven naming ritual,
    Aymm Rhoin, and giving them a proper burial beneath the family's threshold.

    When threatened, botchlings turn into a bigger monster substantially
    rising in size and resembling a ghoul or alghoul
    when they grow spikes on their back.

    Using Axii though will make them retract the spikes for a short time,
    allowing one to safely strike them.
