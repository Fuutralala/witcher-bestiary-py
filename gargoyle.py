    "It just me, or is that gargoyle ogling us?"
    - Lara Estevann, burglar from Loc Muinne

    Gargoyles are stone statues brought to life by magic
    in order to guard mages' laboratories and lairs from intruders.
    Their appearance alone has scared off more than one prospective burglar.
    Those who do not take fright at the sight of these horned
    and winged monstrosities usually die shortly thereafter,
    torn to shreds by stony claws.

    Gargoyles are extremely dangerous opponents. Etched out of granite or marble,
    they are able to withstand tremendous amounts of damage
    and exhibit superhuman strength. One blow dealt from their boulder-like fists
    will crush even a man clad in heavy armor.
    Not even those out of reach of a gargoyle's arms can feel safe,
    for they are able to throw hunks of stone with deadly precision.
