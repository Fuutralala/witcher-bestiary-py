    "The female royal wyvern is smaller but more cunning and venomous
    than her male counterpart. She can be aggressive towards
    both males and other females. She is a perfect example of how gender
    relations among humans have their source in the animal world.
    This is altogether not surprising.!
    -Master Dorgeray, Against the Institution of Marriage

    Royal wyvern â€” this larger and more dangerous breed of wyvern is
    highly aggressive and venomous.
    The creature is particularly terrifying because it has no fear
     of even throngs of peasants armed with pikes and pitchforks.
    This is especially true when it is feeding.


    Class:
    Ornithosaur

    Occurrence:
    Royal wyverns are larger and more aggressive than their common cousins;
    they live in the wilderness, often in the mountains,
    as they like to build their nests on precipices;
    they attack any creature entering their territory

    Immunity
    Resistant to stun attempts
    immune to poison and generally fearless

    Susceptibility:
    Silver
    Ornithosaur Oil

    Tactics:
    They dive at their opponents,
    try to knock them down and poison them with venom;
    they are more clever than common wyverns and thus harder to defeat
