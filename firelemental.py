    "The first fire elemental was created by Ransant Alvaro. Sadly,
    flames engulfed his entire laboratory, burning it along with
    every other building on his block to ash."
    - Tarvix Sandoval, "Origins of Magic Arcana

    Fire is the most destructive of the elements,
    thus the aggressive lethality of the creature that embodies its essence
    should come as no surprise. Fire elementals are forged in complicated
    magic rituals for one purpose: destruction.
    And they pursue this with murderous determination.
    This elemental attacks using fireballs and streams of flame
    which reduce anything in their path to ashes in the blink of an eye.
    Like golems and other elementals, poison does not touch it nor does it bleed.
    Fire-based spells not only do no harm but in fact strengthen it
    thus one should by no means think of striking it with Fire.
    Though vulnerable to silver blades, getting within sword's reach of one
    is dangerous due to the furnace-like heat they emanate.
    When fighting a fire elemental one should thus strike from a distance,
    using frost-spewing and dimeritium bombs, for they will do it the most damage.

    Fire elementals can use similar abilities to an earth elemental,
    with the key difference that fire enhances and empowers them.
    Being harmed by a fire elemental has effects beyond the immediate harm sustained,
    since they can light clothes and armor on fire.
    Simply drawing close to a fire elemental is dangerous,
    due to the intense heat they constantly generate.
