    "Some peasants once offered me a king's ransom to slay a slyzard.
    A damned hefty purse, chock full o' gold... But I turned 'em down.
    Coin's no good if you're dead.
    And a slyzard, that's no fuckin' forktail."
    - Zator, one of the Crinfrid Reavers

    Dracolizard or Slyzard (Polish: Oszluzg), is a large, grey-colored,
    flying reptile, sometimes as big as a dragon,
    for which dracolizards are sometimes mistaken.

    Slyzards are often mistaken for wyverns or forktails.
    Yet make no mistake: slyzards are nasty, terribly dangerous beasts,
    and confusing them for wyverns will end very badly for the confuser.
    While a wyvern can tear apart and devour an untrained man in seconds,
    only a slyzard can first bake him to a crisp with a waft of fiery breath.

    Slyzards are keenly aggressive and attack from both ground and air.
    Their goal during a fight is to get close enough to their foe
    to injure it with a breath of fire or knock it down with a sonic blast.
    Like wyverns, slyzards also attack with venom-spiked tails.
    Slyzards like to disengage mid-fight to fly into the air
    and plummet down at high speed while spewing out balls of fire.
    Right before these igneous missiles emerge,
    you can observe a fiery ball forming in the monster's maw.
    While airborne, a slyzard can also attack with its claws and teeth.
