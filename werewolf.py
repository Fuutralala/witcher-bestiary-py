    "Baron Wolfstein buried his face in his hands. His heart was throbbing.
    Suddenly the scent of his wife's blood and the blood of his children intensified.
    The baron's body swelled as his muscles grew,
    his noble attire fell in tatters on the marble floor.
    'My beloved, you... you are so hairy. You are a werewolf!' Bianca went pale.
    'What about our love?' In reply she heard a terrifying roar."
    - Danielle Stone, The Curse of Baron Wolfstein and Other Love Stories

    Werewolves, sometimes referred to as lycanthropes, are a type of therianthrope:
    a shape-shifter who transforms into another animal as the result of a curse.
    These creatures generally hunt near to human settlements.

    Neither animal, nor man, the Werewolf takes the worst from both species:
    the bloodlust and primal nature of a wolf,
    and the ruthlessness and cruelty of a human.
    One becomes a Werewolf as a result of a curse thrown by a witch.
    The change itself is uncontrollable and unwilling.
    A man who transforms back to his human form
    can't usually remember the atrocious acts committed as a werewolf.
    Werewolves are creatures of the night and they are especially
    active during the full moon. They usually go hunting alone,
    as there rarely is an opponent that can match their strength,
    agility and fast health regeneration.
    If a Werewolf actually encounters an enemy that has equivalent strength
    and can fight a fair fight, the creature can call for wolven reinforcements
    that will come to its aid. A good way of dealing with werewolves
    is a silver sword covered with oil to combat cursed creatures,
    or a Silver Bomb that will temporarily block the creature's regenerative power.

    A werewolf's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal,
    surefire method for doing this.
    A witcher seeking to undertake such a task must there equip himself
    with a great deal of patience, and sturdy armor.
