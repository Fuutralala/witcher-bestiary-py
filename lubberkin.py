    "Legends claim you can bury a botchling under the family's threshold,
    perform a ritual and turn it into a lubberkin.
    That's a sort of, uhh... hob, a guardian spirit that could lead me to your family.
    - Geralt of Rivia to Phillip Strenger

    A lubberkin is a friendly household guardian spirit created
    from a botchling through Aymm Rhoin, an elven naming ritual,
    during which it is given a proper name and a burial
    under the hearth of the family estate.
    A lubberkin looks very similar to a botchling,
    though the main difference being its ghost-like, glowing,
    white aura and relatively passive behavior.
