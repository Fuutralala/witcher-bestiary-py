    "Looks like a flower to me. A hideous, disgusting flower."
    - Blasco Tennerbe, last words

    Some crimes are so terrible that they fill people with terror
    and offend the gods. The criminal's ill will and the cruelty of
    his deed conceive a curse that brings the archespore to life.
    The beast attacks innocent creatures hatefully,
    trying to take vengeance until justice is done.

    Archespores look like gigantic, aesthetically unpleasing flowers
    with some of the traits of exceptionally cruel and bloodthirsty sundews.
    They are, however, far more dangerous that even the most colossal sundew.
    Their peculiar appearance makes them practically impossible
    to discern amidsts other plants. By the time one draws close enough
    to realize what they are, it is often too late to flee.

    According to popular belief, archespores are cursed plants
    grown in soil fertilized by the blood of the dying.
    They are most often found in places which in the past saw pogroms,
    bloody rituals or cruel murders Four types of archespore have been
    catalogued to date, differing from one another in terms of coloring:
    brown (the least dangerous),
    green and purple (the most dangerous).
    The final variant, said to have been cultivated by mages from Ban Ard,
    is the yellow archespore, whose strength is similar to that of its
    green-colored-cousins.

    Regardless of color,
    all archespores fight using similar methods:
    attacking with powerful, jaw-like leaves. If their victim is out of reach,
    they can also spray caustic acid which if it makes any contact whatsoever
    with the skin, can provoke a reaction similar to that
    caused by severe poisoning.

    Like other plants, all archespores are extremely
    vulnerable to fire, which is one of the most
    effective methods of fighting them. Silver also works well,
    as does any sort of shock wave. Archespores do not like strong vibrations,
    which cause them to flee underground at once. Due to the nature of their origins,
    oil damaging to cursed beings can also be useful against them.

    rchespores have several deadly techniques in killing those who come too close.
    From a distance, they shoot a poisonous venom
    that not only causes substantial damage, but will sap your energy.
    Their pods can explode, releasing poison.
    The creature can also lunge forward if you get too close.
    They also have the ability to quickly sink into the ground
    and appear some distance elsewhere, effectively the same as
    a teleport move of other enemies. They will do this if you manage
    to land several attacks in a row (3 Fast Attacks for example)
    and will leave a pod where they sank into the ground;
    if you don't immediately roll away it will explode in your face causing more damage.
    Fighting several of them in a group can be very tricky with
    all of the ranged poison spits from different directions and
    laying of explosive pods all over the place; never stay still in this situation.
