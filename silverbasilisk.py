    "     You want a fine pair of boots, you say?
    Bring me the hide of a silver basilisk,
    and I'll make you boots the whole world will envy."
    - Anatole Vizholy, shoemaker from Beauclair


    The Silver Basilisk (or regulus platinum) is a rare subspecies of basilisk
    that has been hunted to near-extinction.

    Silver Basilisks were once a dominating species,
    especially in the region of Toussaint
    where they were very common around the year 1100.
    Their extirpation in the duchy,
    and possibly near-extinction in the world as a whole,
    is chiefly due to hunting by humans for the monsters' silver-colored hides.
