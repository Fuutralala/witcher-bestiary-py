    "Ulfhedinn? What's that, some kind of fish?"
    - Professor Artibus Joannes Rack, geographer,
    disappeared during a surveying expedition in Skellige

    Ulfhedinn are a breed of werewolf found mainly in Skellige.
    The harsh and barren conditions of the isles might explain
    why they primarily hunt men and are stronger than their continental brethren.
    Older and particularly dangerous ulfhedinn are called olrefs.
    Only a few daring warriors in Skellige history
    have managed to defeat an ulfhedinn,
    and each of them is commemorated in ballads as a hero to this day.
    Like werewolves, ulfhedinn and vorefs are active at night,
    particularly when the moon is at its fullest.
    Fast, strong, and amazingly resilient, these creatures kill with disturbing ease.
    Silver blades should be brought against them, as should Devil's Puffball.
    Take note that when near death the ulfhedinn becomes particularly
    dangerous and will attack with doubled fury,
    while calling on wolves to come to its rescue.

    These breeds of cursed ones are some of the fastest and most lethal.
    They can leap great distances at such speeds
    that it can be a challenge defending against them.
    Yrden is of great use in avoiding these attacks.
    Counterattacks against a werewolf or ulfhedinn can be difficult to time.
    It is best to use footwork and evade them. When possible, use Igni.

    Setting these foes alight can force cursed ones to stay still
    long enough to score critical strikes on their flanks.
    Fire, bleeding, and poison effects can be used to slow
    the regeneration of these creatures.
    Avoid fighting werewolves in tight spaces if at all possible,
    since the speed of their assault can quickly overwhelm even high skilled witchers.
    Werewolves have incredible reach,
    and you want to have space to work with while fighting them.
