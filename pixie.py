    "Look! Pixies!"
    "We should go. Now."
    "Come on, what harm can cute little pixies do us?"
    - last words of two criminals who broke
    into the Land of a Thousand Fables, identities unknown

    Pixies might look like gentle, harmless creatures, yet in their case,
    the saying about appearances being deceiving fits all too perfectly.
    The pixies from the Land of a Thousand Fables were created
    to protect that magic place from intruders and ensure the ducal daughters,
    Sylvia Anna and Anna Henrietta, did not come to even the slightest harm.

    Thus whenever anyone else crossed the pixies' path, it ended badly for them,
    for pixies are aggressive, war-like creatures, created to kill,
    defend and fight till they can fight no more.
