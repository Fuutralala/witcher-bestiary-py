    Werebears, or more commonly known as Berserkers,
    are therianthropes who can transform into bears or half-bears.
    They are particularly famed on Isles,
    where they form an underground group called Vildkaarls.

    Northern legends speak of men known as berserkers
    who transform into bears when overwhelmed by battle rage.
    In doing so, they lose all self-awareness and are driven by a bloodlust
    which they must satiate in order to return to human form.
    Few believe these blood-curdling tales, where the inhabitants usually
    treat even the least probable legends with the utmost gravity.

    This indicates either that berserkers are in fact mere figments
    of mead-sodden imaginations, or else that they have learned to hide their
    abilities from the rest of the islanders.
    The skalds' ballads indicate a berserker transformed in the heat of battle
    cannot be distinguised from a true-born bear.
    Only minute anatomical details - such as the shape of their tongues and
    teeth reveal their secret. Descriptions of their fighting prowess
    paint them as invulnerable to pain and able to
    heal any wound received almost at once.
    If these men-turned-bears truly do exist, one can suppose that,
    like werewolves and lycanthropes, they are particularly vulnerable
    to oils that harm cursed creatured. But if we are to give credence
    to ancient songs about these creatures' deeds,
    about the mass murders and massacres they have committed,
    we can only hope that no witcher will have to test this hypothesis.

    Beyond the anatomical differences,
    a berserker's bear form should be treated just like fighting a true-born Bear,
    save that these bears are much tougher, more relentless and harder to kill.
