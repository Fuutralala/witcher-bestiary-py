    "Forktails... Bah! Fuckers' tails're more like cleavers."
    - Yavinn Buck, veteran of the Mahakaman Volunteer Regiment

    Forktails owe their quaint name to the long sharp growths
    at the tip of their tails. A blow from this weapon can slice an oaken shield
    in two - along with the arm that was carrying it.
    Thus, though its name conjures images of cutlery,
    fighting a forktail is nothing like a dinner party
    and ends in death rather than dessert.
