    "Most dangerous of all are the royal wyverns.
    Or, as they're called in some circles, the royal pains in the arse."
    -Albina Tottelkampf, lecturer in natural sciences at Aretuza

    Wyverns are great flying reptiles with snake-like necks and
    long tails that end in a venomous trident.
    Swooping down from the sky,
    they easily snatch their prey and carry it off to their nest,
    not caring if it is a sheep or a man.

    Typically a wyvern will attack from the air,
    attempting to knock its prey down using its wings.
    After it lands it will attack with its tooth-filled beak
    in an attempt to draw attention away from its most deadly weapon,
    the stinger that can be found at the end of its long tail.
