    A djinn is a powerful air spirit,
    a condensation of the power of that element endowed
    with consciousness and character - the latter usually nasty.
    According to legend, djinn can grant even the most far-fetched wishes,
    though they do so very begrudgingly.

    Unusually powerful mages can capture and tame these beings.
    The mage can then draw on its energy,
    using it to cast spells without having to call on Power from traditional sources.
    Only a sparse handful have managed this feat, however,
    for djinn fight to avoid such a fate with stubborn determination.
    To imprison a djinn and bend it to one's will,
    one must first weaken it - and that is no easy feat.

    Fighting a djinn is extraordinarily difficult.
    They can fling off spells in an instant that the most accomplished
    human mages could never cast with years of preparation. What's more,
    by manipulating the element of air they can summon powerful storms,
    hurricanes, and gales. Luckily, as magic beings,
    they are vulnerable to silver - yet steel will do them no harm.

    Fighting a djinn is about working quickly,
    and not something a witcher should attempt without good cause, or good pay.
    If you must face a djinn, dimeritium bombs are too useful to go without,
    giving a witcher the chance to close the distance without being frozen,
    burned, or electrocuted. Djinn can teleport short distances to escape harm,
    even after being affected by dimeritium bombs.

    A witcher must be able to quickly react to this and continue to pressure the djinn,
    using additional bombs as necessary to continue suppressing spells.
