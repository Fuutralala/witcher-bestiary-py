    "How to survive an encounter with an earth element?
    Simple. Run. Fast as you can."
    - Nino Murk, bounty hunter

    Earth elementals are made of mud, clay, sand and rock dust clumped
    together with water and brought alive with magic. While seemingly slow
    and ponderous, there creatures are nevertheless dangerous and should
    be avoided at all costs.

    Earth elementals can withstand a tremendous amount of punishment.
    Due to their enormous mass they are virtually impossible to knock off balance.
    They do not bleed nor feel any pain from poison or even fire.
    They kill men with astonishing ease - whether by smashing them with their
    fists or hurling enormous stones at them.
    Their only weakness is their vulnerability to dimeritium dust
    thus before combat one should prepare a full arsenal
    of bombs containing this ingredient.

    Earth elementals are a test of strength and endurance.
    Even with a silver sword coated in elementa oil, earth elementals
    can resist impressive amounts of punishment before crumbling,
    while being able to dish out frighteningly powerful blows with their fists.
