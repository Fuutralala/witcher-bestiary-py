    An ice elemental is a mass of frozen water animated by magic.
    Deprived of consciousness or independent will,
    this elemental is boundlessly obedient to the orders
    of the mage who created it.

    Those orders usually contain but one syllable: kill.
    Ice elementals have no qualms about carrying out this order
    nor any particular difficulty in doing so. Gifted with incredible strength,
    they are completely invulnerable to poison and fire,
    deprived of sensitive organs,
    hard as permafrost and all in all incredibly difficult opponents.

    The only chance at tipping the scales towards victory is to
    toss a dimeritium bomb.
    Shrapnel made of this metal interferes with the workings
    of the spell that gives this creature life.
    Beyond that remains only prayer.
