        Cockatrice, also known as a skoffin and kurolishek, is an ornithosaur.
        It's also the only creature to belong to the order of ornithoreptile
        according to scholars, but why exactly they decided on this is not revealed.
        Its central tail feathers are also valuable as they're more durable and
        sharpen better than regular goose feathers for quills.
